# Round 916 
19/12/2023  
Div 3  
Took live, managed to complete 7/8 questions!!  
Easily the best I have done out of all live/virtual contests.  
Solution for F worked but got stack overflow as was using recursion, converting to a stack worked.  
Not really sure when to use recursion and when to use queues. Maybe I should always go for the queue even if harder to think of.
